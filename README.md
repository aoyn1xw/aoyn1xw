# Hey, I'm Erdi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student from Germany. When I'm not at school, you'll usually find me coding, gaming, or just listening to music.  

I enjoy experimenting with small coding projects and discovering new things in tech. Outside of that, I love exploring new music, diving into games, or just chilling with a good playlist.
